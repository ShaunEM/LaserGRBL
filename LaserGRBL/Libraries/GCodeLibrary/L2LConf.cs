/*
Gnnn	Standard GCode command, such as move to a point
Mnnn	RepRap-defined command, such as turn on a cooling fan
Tnnn	Select tool nnn. In RepRap, a tool is typically associated with a nozzle, which may be fed by one or more extruders.
Snnn	Command parameter, such as time in seconds; temperatures; voltage to send to a motor
Pnnn	Command parameter, such as time in milliseconds; proportional (Kp) in PID Tuning
Xnnn	A X coordinate, usually to move to. This can be an Integer or Fractional number.
Ynnn	A Y coordinate, usually to move to. This can be an Integer or Fractional number.
Znnn	A Z coordinate, usually to move to. This can be an Integer or Fractional number.
U,V,W	Additional axis coordinates (RepRapFirmware)
Innn	Parameter - X-offset in arc move; integral (Ki) in PID Tuning
Jnnn	Parameter - Y-offset in arc move
Dnnn	Parameter - used for diameter; derivative (Kd) in PID Tuning
Hnnn	Parameter - used for heater number in PID Tuning
Fnnn	Feedrate in mm per minute. (Speed of print head movement)
Rnnn	Parameter - used for temperatures
Qnnn	Parameter - not currently used
Ennn	Length of extrudate. This is exactly like X, Y and Z, but for the length of filament to consume.
Nnnn	Line number. Used to request repeat transmission in the case of communications errors.
;		Gcode comments begin at a semicolon
